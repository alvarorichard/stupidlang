# StupidLang Minimal Compiler

StupidLang is a minimal programming language designed purely for educational purposesâ€”to help you understand LLVM and LLVM IR. The language is extremely simple: it only supports a single instruction, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

This project demonstrates how to:

- Create a basic parser (that accepts the token hello).

- Generate LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) using LLVM's C++ API.

- Build a native binary by converting LLVM IR to assembly (`using llc`) and then linking (`using clang`).

Note: This project is intended only for studying and understanding LLVM and LLVM IR. It is not designed for production use.


## Features

- Minimal Parser: Reads a source file (ignoring whitespace) and expects the token hello.

- LLVM IR Generation: Constructs an LLVM module with a main() function that calls puts() to print "Hello, World!".

- Compilation Pipeline: Automates the process of compiling the compiler, generating LLVM IR, converting IR to assembly, and finally linking to produce the executable.


## Dependencies

macOS

- LLVM and Clang:

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install llvm clang 
```

Note: Homebrew installs LLVM as a keg-only package. Typically, the headers and libraries are located at:

- Intel Macs: `/usr/local/opt/llvm`

- Apple Silicon: `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm`


Linux
- LLVM and Clang:

Install using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install llvm clang libllvm-dev
```

- Ensure your system has C++17 support.

### Project Files

-  main.cpp: Contains the source code for the StupidLang compiler.

- build.sh: A shell script that automates building the compiler, generating LLVM IR, converting the IR to assembly, and linking to create the final executable.

- program.hl: The StupidLang source file (automatically generated by the build script with the content hello).

## Build

To build the StupidLang compiler, run the build script:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

and then:

```bash
./install.sh
```
